This is a solver for sudoku using a backtracking algorithm. 
It essentially tries a possible solution for one field in the 
grid and continues until it is clear if the number is correct or not. 
In the latter case, it changes the last choice (of a possible solution) 
and continues using the backtracking algorithm until it has the solution.
